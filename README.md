# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

This is a text-based adventure provided by an API in form of a labyrinth.

The goal was to use the API and build an interface that gives the user control over what to do next. Focus was on the global state management with Zustand to store the data from the API into the global state.

### The Problem

The hardest part for me was to get the data from the API and how to use it so that the user can control where to go. Async/await was new to me and feels a little complicated to me with all the steps.

It was also a challenge to make the right arrow images to show depending on which direction the user have to choose. I tried different solutions and the thing that worked was to do a conditional rendering based on the direction.

If I had more time I would make the direction buttons to show on different positions in the browser. Like north should be at the top, south at the bottom and so on. I tried but I just couldn't get it to work. I would also show different images in the backround depending on the text.
