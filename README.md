# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

In this pair project, we built a text based adventure using Zustand for state management and an API from Technigo to post data.

### The Problem

This week, I took a less effective approach. I relied on an AI to provide the project structure, resulting in three components I didn't fully understand. This led to spending most of the week deciphering the code. Instead If I had writedn the code myself would have been a more valuable learning experience.
