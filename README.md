# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

This app is a text-based adventure game where players navigate through a labyrinth. It fetches data from an API using Zustand for state management. 

### The Problem

Couldn't get the the fetching from the API to work. It would only let me fetch the last step. Was stuck on the zustand state management and API for the majority of the time. It's still complicated to me. I had to look at other teammates code structure to get going with the project. 

Other techniques used is react hooks such as useState and useEffect. In the Maze component, useState manages component state variables, while useEffect handles side effects like delayed state updates and response to data changes. We also have conditional rendering for different parts of the UI based on the application state. Lastly we have the user interactions like input changes, button clicks and option selection (event handlers) for the user to get through the maze game.

I didn't spend the time and effort I wanted on the design since the project was overdue. I decided not to go fullscreen in the game, based on personal preference. I was also thinking about those free online games you played when you were younger, which weren't fullscreen, and I wanted to go with that approach. If I had added arrows and used animated pictures, it would have made more sense for me to go fullscreen. Which is something I would have loved to do if I had the time.
