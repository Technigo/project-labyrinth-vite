# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

### The Project

This weeks project was to create a labyrinth using a texted based API and global stated using Zustand.

### The Problem

We were both traveling this week, so we mostly worked asynchronous. First we checked the API using Postman. Then we fixed the fetches and displayed description, coordinates and actions. The user is encuraged to enter a unique username because the API has all the old inputs stored.
The user walks through a path by clicking on buttons. The background pictures are connected to the apis coordinates and change using useRef. The page is responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop. The accessibility score in Lighthouse is 100.
