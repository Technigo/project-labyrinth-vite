# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

The Labyrinth - Zustand Project utilized Zustand for global state management to create an interactive game that fetches data from an API.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

We started by designing the game's interface in Figma and efficiently handled the global state using Zustand, ensuring seamless data retrieval from the backend through async methods and the fetch API. We employed React for the user interface, utilizing pair programming, async techniques, and branching strategies to steadily implement features while maintaining a structured workflow for consistent progress.
