# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

This project is a text-based adventure game where players navigate through a labyrinth by making choices presented to them. The game utilizes Zustand for state management and communicates with a backend API to retrieve game data and post player actions.

### The Problem

For this project, we tackled the challenge of creating a text-based adventure game using Zustand for state management. Our approach involved structuring the game logic around the interactions between the player and the labyrinth, handling API requests for retrieving game data and posting player actions. We planned our development process by discussing the project requirements, defining component structure, and outlining state management strategies. The main technologies used include React for building the UI, Zustand for managing global state, and asynchronous operations for API requests.

If more time were available, we would focus on enhancing the user experience by implementing additional features such as displaying action history, styling each room based on its description, and persisting game data using localStorage.
