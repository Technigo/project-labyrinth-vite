### Project

This project involves building a text-based adventure game using React and Zustand for state management. Players interact with the game via POST requests to an API, navigating through choices that dictate their path and update the game state. The design focuses on handling API response delays and ensuring a good user experience, with Zustand managing game state and localStorage preserving progress. This combines technical functionality with creative interface design.

### The Problem

The challenge lay in grasping the game's logic, especially how player choices interact with API requests to influence game progression. Additionally, it was crucial to ensure the game was user-friendly and displayed effectively across both mobile and desktop platforms.
