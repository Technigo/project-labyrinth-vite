# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

In this pair project, we built a text based adventure using Zustand for state management and an API from Technigo to post data.

### The Problem

We approached the problem by laying out the components and stores we needed. We then ensured that the API calls worked as intended. We identified the states that should be defined globally with Zustand and used them in the components. As a next step, we made sure to implement a user-friendly design that would allow the user to quickly understand what to do.

If we had more time we would look into more of the stretch goals.
