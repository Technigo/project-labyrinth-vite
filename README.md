# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

### The Problem

This week we're practicing using Zustand by creating a classic text-based adventure game from the Technigo API. The storyline is done; all we have to do is create the logic and style.

I found it pretty easy to get the basics down. The app is working now, from what I can tell. _I can't figure out how to get it to restart with the same username, though._

#### Requirements

- Your Labyrinth game should guide the user with instructions about the game and moves to make
- Use Zustand to store the current state of the game
- Perform asynchronous operations in the app store
- Focus on making the UX of your app good. Handle the response delay
- Don't forget CSS! Your Labyrinth should be well-styled

#### Next

- Basic styling
- Display history

- I would like to do the classic look, with the game playing out in "the terminal". So it's going to take some styling, as well as some added functionality. For the real authentic feel, the user should have to type the commands aswell... don't really know how I would go about that. We'll see if I have time.
