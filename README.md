# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

Zustand Project  - make a labyrint game where all the actions in the game are given with posts to api.

## Getting Started with the Project

Initially I waited to be paired up with someone, but when that wasn't possible I just got cracking.
i started with the basics, just getting the name from the user, and posting that in the json to see what i got from the API. Then I proceeded to build logic to be able to handle the different choices.


### The Problem

Spendt a lot of time playing with animation, images and shapes, before I saw that less is more, and it looked quite cluttered and crazy, and spent a lot of time removing it all ðŸ˜‚.
Should probably used my time a bit better and worked on making a design before starting, and going for making a map, and store the choices in local storage. but on the other hand I had fun with animation and clipping masks, even if i didn't actually use them all.
