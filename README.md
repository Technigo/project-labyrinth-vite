# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

Build a text-based adventure using Zustand for state management and API to post data.

### The Problem

I made the button disable while loading so you couldnt do two actions. I used a dynamic class name on the navigation buttons to be able to position them like on a compass. If I had more time I would add more visual elements.
