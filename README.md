# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

The assignment was to make a text based adventure using Zustand for state management and using data from an API.

### The Problem

I started as usual by planning my different components. And then to get the game running. Then focused on adding appealing pictures to draw in the players while keeping the design clean and simple.
