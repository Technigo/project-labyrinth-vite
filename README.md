# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

A project to practise Global State and useRef hook to maintain and store user preferences throughout a simple Labyrinth game.

### The Problem

I started by creating the user store followed by the components for functionality. The most time consuming part of this project was to figure out how to use CSS to make all elements appear where and when I wanted them. Super fun project! If I had more time, I'd put more effort on the design and make it look neat.
