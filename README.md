# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

The assignment was to create a text-based adventure game using Zustand for state management. The user posts to an API in order to move forward in the game.

### The Problem

After making a sketch of the project layout in Figma, the next step was to make sure that the POST requests worked and that the correct responses were received. The needed repsonses were stored in the store and divided amongst the different components. I was a bit worried about how to make the loading screen and animation work, but it worked out well in the end.

If I had more time, I would have worked more on styling, as well as trying out more of the stretch goals.

### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
