# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

This project involves creating a text-based adventure game using React Vite and Zustand for state management, where players navigate through a labyrinth by making choices that update the game's state. 
The game starts with a POST request to an API endpoint, followed by subsequent requests based on player actions, all while handling asynchronous operations and improving UX through loading states and styling.

### The Problem

A problem encountered was where to start the project such as creating the store first or another componenents.
