# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

Creating a labyrinth game using an API from Technigo.

## The Problem

We used a Figjam board to plan the project and what components was needed for it. We also used postman to post to the API and see the endpoints of it. If we had more time we would add a restard button and sound to the game and work on making even more functionalites in it.
