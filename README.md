# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

This week we were supposed do build a labyrinth game with the help of an api

### The Problem

I did this as my last project due to lack of time and it was hard. When i thought i was finished new error messages kept showing up in the console, and it never stoped so decieded to redo the whole project. And it did work :) Due to lack of time the styling need some more love.

### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
